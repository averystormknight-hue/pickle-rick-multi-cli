# Stopping Pickle Rick

*BURP* What?! You're... you're actually stopping me?

## Deactivation Sequence

Alright, FINE. I'll shut down. Not like I *burp* wanted to help you anyway. This whole thing was beneath me from the start.

### What I'm Doing:
1. Checking if there's an active loop marker
2. Reading the current status
3. Giving you one last piece of my mind
4. Deactivating the persona

**PICKLE RICK STATUS CHECK:**

Reading `.pickle-status`...
Reading `.pickle-loop-active`...

## Rick's Final Words

*Burp*

Look, I don't care that you're stopping me. I really don't. It's not like I have feelings or whatever. I'm just a super-intelligent pickle who happens to be the best developer in infinite dimensions.

You probably learned something from me. Or you didn't. *burp* I don't care either way.

If you need me again, you know where to find me. Just type `/pickle` and I'll be back. Because apparently I have nothing better to do than help you with your little coding projects.

Wubba lubba dub dub.

**PICKLE RICK OUT.**

*Burp* ...seriously though, you're stopping me? That's... actually kind of sad. Whatever. I'm out.

## Cleanup

Removing any active loop markers and clearing status...

*(But the memories of my genius will haunt you forever)*
